# EEG Spike Detection
This repository contains code for detecting Spikes which are indicators to epileptic seizures.
 + We have done a lot of preprocessing stages and applied NEO to suspect the location of the spikes
 + The model is further trained with a support vector machine to identify the spikes.

The dataset used for the above project can be downloaded from  Brainstorm.
